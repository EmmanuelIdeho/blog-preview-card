## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Card design

### What I learned


```html
The <picture> tag gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources. The most common use of the <picture> element will be for art direction in responsive designs.
```

```css
.cluster {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: var(--space-150);
    justify-content: flex-start;
    align-items: center;
  }
```

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp) - This helped me to implement the box shadow. I really liked how this website taught this pattern and will use it going forward.
